# Introduction to Lists
A list is a collection of items, and it's one of the most commonly used data structures in Python. Lists are defined using square brackets [] and can contain elements of different data types, such as integers, strings, or even other lists.

In programming, a list is a data structure that allows you to store an ordered collection of elements. Each element within a list is identified by a numerical position called an index. Lists are a fundamental way to organize, store, and manipulate data in many programming languages, including Python.

## Key characteristics of lists:

### Ordering: 
  Elements in a list maintain a specific order, meaning the first element added to the list will be the first element in the list, and so on.

### Index-Based Access: 
  Each element in a list is associated with a numeric index that starts counting from zero. This allows you to access individual elements using their index.

### Mutability: 
  Lists in many programming languages, like Python, are mutable, which means you can add, remove, and modify elements after the list is created.

### Mixed Data Types: 
  A list can contain elements of different data types, such as integers, floating-point numbers, strings, other objects, and even other lists.

In Python, lists are defined using square brackets [], and elements are separated by commas. Here's a simple example of creating a list:

```python

fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange', 'grape']
```

In this example, the fruits list contains four elements, where 'apple' is at index 0, 'banana' is at index 1, 'orange' is at index 2, and 'grape' is at index 3.

Lists are incredibly versatile and are used for a variety of tasks, from storing simple data to representing more complex data structures like tables and queues. They are one of the fundamental data structures in programming and play an essential role in manipulating and organizing information.
## Creating a List
```python

fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange', 'grape']
In this example, we've created a list named fruits containing four string elements.
```

## Adding and Removing Elements
Appending Elements
You can add elements to the end of a list using the .append() method.

```python

fruits.append('kiwi')

After running this code, the fruits list will now contain 'kiwi' at the end.
```

## Inserting Elements
You can insert elements at a specific index using the .insert() method.

```python

fruits.insert(1, 'pear')

This inserts 'pear' at index 1, pushing the existing elements to the right.
```

## Removing Elements
To remove an element, you can use methods like .remove() or .pop().

```python

fruits.remove('banana')  # Removes 'banana' from the list
popped_fruit = fruits.pop(2)  # Removes the element at index 2 and returns it
```

## Clearing a List
To remove all elements from a list, you can use the .clear() method.

```python

fruits.clear()

```

## Checking for Items
You can check if an item is in a list using the in and not in operators.

```python

if 'apple' in fruits:
    print('An apple is in the list!')

if 'kiwi' not in fruits:
    print('No kiwi in the list.')

```

## List Operations
Concatenating Lists
You can concatenate two lists using the + operator.

```python

combined_list = fruits + ['mango', 'pineapple']

```

## Replicating Lists
You can replicate a list by using the * operator.

```python

doubled_fruits = fruits * 2

```
Iterating Through a List
You can iterate through a list using a for loop.

```python

for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
```

## List Length
You can get the length of a list using the len() function.

```python

num_fruits = len(fruits)

```
Lists are versatile data structures in Python that allow you to store and manipulate ordered collections of values. Here's a summary of key concepts related to lists, along with easy-to-understand examples:

## Creating Lists
A list is created using square brackets and elements separated by commas.

```python

lottery_numbers = [4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42]
student_names = ['Diedre', 'Hank', 'Helena', 'Salome']
person = ['Jess', 32]
```

## Accessing List Elements
You can access list elements using their index, which starts counting from 0.

```python

student_names = ['Diedre', 'Hank', 'Helena', 'Salome']
print(student_names[2])  # Output: Helena
```

## Modifying List Elements
You can modify list elements using their index.

```python

student_names = ['Diedre', 'Hank', 'Helena', 'Salome']
student_names[1] = 'Joshua'
print(student_names)  # Output: ['Diedre', 'Joshua', 'Helena', 'Salome']
```
## List Functions
Python provides built-in functions for working with lists.

len(list): Returns the number of items in the list.
max(list): Returns the largest value in the list.
min(list): Returns the smallest value in the list.

```python

costs = [1.2, 4.3, 2.0, 0.5]
print(len(costs))  # Output: 4
print(max(costs))  # Output: 4.3
print(min(costs))  # Output: 0.5

```

## Sorting and Reversing Lists
Python offers functions to sort and reverse list elements.

```python

costs = [1.2, 4.3, 2.0, 0.5]
print(sorted(costs))          # Output: [0.5, 1.2, 2.0, 4.3]
print(list(reversed(costs)))  # Output: [0.5, 2.0, 4.3, 1.2]
```

## Checking List Membership
You can check if an item is in a list using the in operator.

```python

student_names = ['Diedre', 'Hank', 'Helena', 'Salome']
if 'Hank' in student_names:
    print('Hank is in the class')
else:
    print('Hank is not in the class')
```

## Appending Items to a List
You can add items to the end of a list using the .append() method.

```python

students = ['Diedre', 'Hank', 'Helena', 'Salome']
student_name = input('What is the name of the new student? ')
students.append(student_name)
print(students)
```

Exercise 4.3 - Shopping List

```python
shopping_list = ['bread', 'cheese', 'pop tarts', 'carrots']
if 'bread' in shopping_list:
    shopping_list.append('butter')
```

In this exercise, if 'bread' is present in the shopping list, 'butter' is added to the list. The in operator checks item presence, and the .append() method adds items.

# Lists and For Loops

## Using Lists with For Loops
You can use lists and for loops together to iterate through each element in a list.

```python

student_names = ['Diedre', 'Hank', 'Helena', 'Salome']
for student_name in student_names:
    print(student_name)
```

## Counting List Elements
You can count the total number of items in a list using a for loop.

```python

student_names = ['Diedre', 'Hank', 'Helena', 'Salome']
count = 0
for student_name in student_names:
    count = count + 1
print(count)  # Output: 4
```

## Summing List Elements
Using a for loop to calculate the total cost of expenses:

```python

costs = [8.30, 7.12, 5.01, 1.00, 0.99, 5.92, 3.50]
total_cost = 0
for cost in costs:
    total_cost = total_cost + cost
print(total_cost)  # Output: 31.839999999999996

```

## Using the sum() Function
A more concise way to calculate the total cost using the sum() function:

```python

costs = [8.30, 7.12, 5.01, 1.00, 0.99, 5.92, 3.50]
total = sum(costs)
print(total)  # Output: 31.839999999999996
```

# Dictionaries
## What are Dictionaries?
A dictionary stores a collection of labeled items, where each item has a key and a value.

```python

person = {
    'name': 'Jessica',
    'age': 23,
    'height': 172
}
```
## Accessing Dictionary Values
You can access values in a dictionary using their keys.

```python

person = {
    'name': 'Jessica',
    'age': 23,
    'height': 172
}
print(person['name'])  # Output: Jessica
```

## Dictionary within a Dictionary
You can nest dictionaries within dictionaries.

```python

place = {
    'name': 'The Anchor',
    'post_code': 'E14 6HY',
    'street_number': '54',
    'location': {
        'longitude': 127,
        'latitude': 63
    }
}
print(place['name'])  # Output: The Anchor
print(place['location']['longitude'])  # Output: 127
```

## Dictionaries in Lists
Dictionaries can be stored inside a list.

```python
people = [
    {'name': 'Jessica', 'age': 23},
    {'name': 'Trisha', 'age': 24}
]
for person in people:
    print(person['name'])
    print(person['age'])
```

## Random Choice
You can use the choice() function from the random module to select a random item from a list.

```python

import random
colours = ['red', 'green', 'blue']
chosen_colour = random.choice(colours)
print(chosen_colour)  # Output: green
```

### Exercises
#### Exercise 4.4
```python

costs = [8.30, 7.12, 5.01, 1.00, 0.99, 5.92, 3.50]
total_cost = 0
for cost in costs:
    total_cost = total_cost + cost
print(total_cost)  # Output: 31.839999999999996
```
#### Exercise 4.5
```python

place = {
    'name': 'The Anchor',
    'post_code': 'E14 6HY',

    'location': {
        'longitude': 127,
        'latitude': 63
    }
}
print(place['name'])  # Output: The Anchor
print(place['post_code'])  # Output: E14 6HY
print(place['street_number'])  # Output: 54
print(place['location']['longitude'])  # Output: 127
print(place['location']['latitude'])  # Output: 63
```
### Exercise 4.6
```python

fruits = [
    {'name': 'apple', 'colour': 'red', 'price': 0.12},
    {'name': 'banana', 'colour': 'yellow', 'price': 0.2},
    {'name': 'pear', 'colour': 'green', 'price': 0.19}
]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit['name'])
    print(fruit['colour'])
    print(fruit['price'])

```
### Exercise 4.7
```python
import random

first_names = ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie', 'David']
last_names = ['Smith', 'Johnson', 'Williams', 'Brown']

random_first_name = random.choice(first_names)
random_last_name = random.choice(last_names)

print(random_first_name, random_last_name)
```
These concepts—lists, dictionaries, for loops, and random choices—are essential building blocks in Python programming that enable you to store, manipulate, and process data effectively.
