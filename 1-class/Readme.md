<!-- ABOUT THE LESSON -->
## About The Lesson

Welcome to the first lesson of the Python and App Development course! In this lesson, I got introduced to the Python programming language and learned about the fundamentals that form the building blocks of Python programming. I also explored numbers, operators, strings, variables, and basic input/output concepts.

<!-- WHAT I LEARNED -->
## What I Learned

During this lesson, I covered the following key concepts:

<!-- NUMBERS AND OPERATORS -->
## Numbers and Operators

I learned about different data types in Python, such as integers and floats, and how to perform various mathematical operations using operators. Here are some examples:

```python
# Addition
5 + 2  # Output: 7

# Subtraction
10 - 3  # Output: 7

# Multiplication
4 * 5  # Output: 20

# Division
10 / 3  # Output: 3.3333333333333335

# Exponentiation
2 ** 3  # Output: 8

# Modulo (remainder)
15 % 4  # Output: 3
<!-- THE STRING DATA TYPE -->
The String Data Type
I explored strings, which are used to represent text in Python. Strings must be written between single or double quotes. Here are some examples:

# Single quotes
single_quotes = 'This is a string.'

# Double quotes
double_quotes = "This is also a string."
<!-- VARIABLES -->
Variables
Variables are reusable labels for data values in Python. I learned how to create variables and assign values to them. Variables can be used anywhere that a data value can be used.

# Assigning variables
username = 'sarah_1987'
age = 23

# Variables are interchangeable
print(username)  # Output: 'sarah_1987'
print(age)       # Output: 23
<!-- STRING FORMATTING -->
String Formatting
I discovered string formatting using the .format() method. It allows me to substitute placeholders with values in a string.

# String formatting
oranges = 12
cost_per_orange = 0.5
output = "{} oranges cost £{}".format(oranges, oranges * cost_per_orange)
print(output)  # Output: "12 oranges cost £6.0"


<!-- COMMENTS -->
Comments
I learned about comments, which are human-readable notes in the code. Comments start with a # and are ignored by Python when the code is executed.

# This is a comment

# A program to calculate the cost of some oranges
oranges = 12
cost_per_orange = 0.5
total_cost = oranges * cost_per_orange
output = "{} oranges cost £{}".format(oranges, total_cost)
print(output)

<!-- RECAP -->
Recap
In this lesson, I explored fundamental concepts in Python, such as data types, variables, operators, strings, and comments. I also practiced using the Python console and writing Python files.
