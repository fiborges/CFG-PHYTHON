Date and Time:
The datetime module provides classes to work with dates and times. For example, the date class represents a date (year, month, day), and the time class represents a time (hour, minute, second, microsecond). These classes allow you to manipulate and extract information from dates and times.

Datetime:
The datetime class combines both date and time information. It represents a specific point in time, including the date, time, and microsecond components. This is useful for tasks that require working with both date and time data together.

import datetime

# Create a date object
date_obj = datetime.date(2023, 7, 15)
print("Date:", date_obj)  # Output: Date: 2023-07-15

# Create a time object
time_obj = datetime.time(12, 30, 15)
print("Time:", time_obj)  # Output: Time: 12:30:15


import datetime

# Create a datetime object
datetime_obj = datetime.datetime(2023, 7, 15, 12, 30, 15)
print("Datetime:", datetime_obj)  # Output: Datetime: 2023-07-15 12:30:15


Timedelta:
The timedelta class represents a duration or the difference between two dates or times. It allows you to perform arithmetic operations like addition or subtraction with dates, which is useful for calculating time intervals or determining deadlines.

import datetime

# Calculate the difference between two dates
date1 = datetime.date(2023, 7, 15)
date2 = datetime.date(2023, 7, 10)
time_difference = date1 - date2
print("Time Difference:", time_difference)  # Output: Time Difference: 5 days, 0:00:00



Converting Text to Date Objects:
The datetime.strptime() function enables you to convert text into datetime objects. This is useful when you have dates or times in string format and need to convert them into Python's datetime objects for further manipulation.

import datetime

# Convert text to a datetime object
date_string = "2023-07-15"
date_obj = datetime.datetime.strptime(date_string, "%Y-%m-%d")
print("Date Object:", date_obj)  # Output: Date Object: 2023-07-15 00:00:00


Performing Date Calculations:
With datetime and timedelta objects, you can perform various date calculations, such as finding the difference between two dates, adding or subtracting time intervals, or comparing dates to check if one is greater than or less than the other.

import datetime

# Calculate a future date
current_date = datetime.date.today()
days_to_add = datetime.timedelta(days=7)
future_date = current_date + days_to_add
print("Future Date:", future_date)  # Output: Future Date: 2023-07-26 + 7 days

Formatting Dates for Display:
The strftime() method allows you to format datetime objects into human-readable strings. It provides a way to represent dates and times in various formats, making them more understandable and visually appealing for displaying to users.

import datetime

# Format a datetime object as a string
datetime_obj = datetime.datetime(2023, 7, 15, 12, 30, 15)
formatted_date = datetime_obj.strftime("%B %d, %Y %H:%M:%S")
print("Formatted Date:", formatted_date)  # Output: Formatted Date: July 15, 2023 12:30:15

Overall, the datetime module is a versatile and essential tool for handling date and time-related tasks in Python. Whether it's working with dates, times, or performing calculations involving timedeltas, this module provides the necessary functionalities to make date and time manipulation efficient and straightforward.

Character codes examples:
%a: Returns the first three characters of the weekday, e.g. Wed.
%A: Returns the full name of the weekday, e.g. Wednesday.
%B: Returns the full name of the month, e.g. September.
%w: Returns the weekday as a number, from 0 to 6, with Sunday being 0.
%m: Returns the month as a number, from 01 to 12.
%p: Returns AM/PM for time.
%f: Returns microsecond from 000000 to 999999.
%Z: Returns the timezone.
%Y: Returns the year in four digit format
%b: Returns the first three characters of the month name.
%d: Returns day of the month, from 1 to 31.
%Y: Returns the year in four-digit format.
%H: Returns the hour.
%M: Returns the minute, from 00 to 59.
%S: Returns the second, from 00 to 59.
