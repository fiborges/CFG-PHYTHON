# Team Project Briefs
During this course, you'll be engaged in team projects that offer valuable hands-on experience. 
In the final session, each team will present their completed project to the class.

### Exercise 6.1: 
  Choosing a Project
Read through the provided project briefs and decide which one your team would like to work on.

### Teaming Up
Form teams consisting of 2-3 members for effective collaboration.

### Planning and Prioritizing Requirements
After finishing the mandatory tasks, you can enhance the project according to your vision. The MoSCoW technique is utilized to categorize requirements:

Must: Essential and non-negotiable requirements
Should: Important but not vital
Could: Desirable if possible
Won't: Unnecessary or unfeasible requirements


Example: Book Search Project Requirements
Must: Users can search for books by name; Author is displayed in results
Should: Price of book appears in search results
Could: Display book cover in search results
Won't: Enable direct book ordering from Amazon

## A MoSCoW technique 
  is a prioritization framework used to categorize project requirements based on their level of importance and necessity. 
  It helps teams and stakeholders understand what must be delivered, what should be included if possible, what could be added for additional value, 
  and what won't be included in the current scope.

M - Must Have: These are critical requirements that are non-negotiable for the project's success. Without these, the project cannot be considered complete.

S - Should Have: These requirements are important but not absolutely necessary. They significantly enhance the project's value but can be 
deferred if absolutely needed.

C - Could Have: These are desirable requirements that would provide additional value, but their absence won't jeopardize the core 
functionality of the project.

W - Won't Have: These requirements are explicitly out of scope for the current project iteration. They can be considered for future 
enhancements but won't be considered for the current release.

Example: Booking System Project

Imagine you are developing a booking system for a hotel. Here's how you might apply the MoSCoW technique:

### Must Have:

Users can view available rooms.
Users can select a room and book it.
Users receive a confirmation email after booking.

### Should Have:

Users can view room details and amenities.
Users can see room availability for specific dates.
Users can modify or cancel bookings.

### Could Have:

Integration with a payment gateway for online payments.
User profiles with booking history.
Real-time availability updates.

### Won't Have:

Advanced analytics for user booking patterns.
Social media sharing features.
In this example, the "Must Have" requirements are crucial for the booking system to function properly. 
The "Should Have" requirements add significant user value, while the "Could Have" features provide further enhancements. 
The "Won't Have" items are deemed unnecessary for the initial project scope.

### Exercise 6.3: 
  Brainstorming Ideas
Each team member generates project enhancement ideas.
Share and discuss one idea per team member.
Collaboratively prioritize the ideas into the MoSCoW categories.

### Project Work
Collaborate with your team to work on the chosen project. Utilize these tips:

Organize your code into functions.
Share your progress with team members regularly.
Break down complex tasks into manageable steps.
