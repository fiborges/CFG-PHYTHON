# Project Brief: Search
In this project you'll create a program to search for recipes based on an ingredient. The standard
project uses the Edamam

# Introduction
The Recipe Search Program is a Python application designed to search for recipes based on a user-provided ingredient. The program utilizes the Edamam Recipe API to fetch recipe data based on the ingredient query. This project showcases how to interact with an external API, retrieve and display recipe information, and offers opportunities for further customization and enhancement.

# Project Overview
The Recipe Search Program achieves the following objectives:

Prompts the user to enter an ingredient they want to search for.
Makes a request to the Edamam API with the provided ingredient to retrieve recipe data.
Displays a list of recipe search results with basic information.
Offers options for saving results to a file, ordering results by calories, selecting a specific recipe, showing random suggestions, and filtering by diet label.

## Setup
To use the Recipe Search Program:

Register for an Edamam account and obtain your Application ID and Application Key.

## Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/recipe-search.git
```
## Navigate to the project directory:
```bash

cd recipe-search
```
Update the APP_ID and APP_KEY variables in the code with your own Edamam credentials.

## Required Tasks
Prompt the user to enter an ingredient for the search.
Use the provided ingredient to make a request to the Edamam API.
Retrieve and display the recipe search results.

## Usage
Run the program using the following command:

```bash

python recipe_search.py
```
Follow the on-screen prompts to enter the ingredient, explore recipe search results, and interact with the program's features.

## Ideas for Extension
Beyond the required tasks, consider enhancing the program:

Save the results to a file.
Order the results by different criteria.
Ask additional questions to guide recipe selection.
Incorporate the Edamam nutrition analysis API for deeper insights.
Explore other recipe APIs for different sources of recipe data.
